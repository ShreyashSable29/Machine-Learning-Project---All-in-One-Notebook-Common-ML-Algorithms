# Machine-Learning-Project---All-in-One-Notebook-Common-ML-Algorithms
The repository is created which contains all the ML types algorithms which can be commonly used for Building the models. All the alogorithms are not present but some algorithms are used to create the notebook. The DataSet used in this is Ecommerse Customers DataSet obtained from open sourse.

The purpose of this All-in-one Notebook is to illustrate the modelling workflow of common ML techniques (Processing, Modeling, Predicting, Evaluating). The tuning is not focused. You are recommended to do further research on it.
There are 2 main problems in ML:

Regressions: Predicting a quantity - For example: yearly_amount_spent
Classification: Classify the observations into class (label) - For example: High-Value Users (one with yearly_amount_spent > q0.8)
Note: Though it might not show in this notebook: SVM, Boosting (XGBoost, GBM, LightGBM), Tree-based (Decision-Tree, Random Forest) => Can work on boht problems with Regressor and Classifier, respectively (Fore example, in this notebook XGBRegressor and XGBClassifier is shown.
There are 3 main types of ML algorithms:

Supervised Learning: Have an observed label/target/outcome to be predicted from a set of predictors. We generate a functions to map inputs to the desired outputs (Linear Regressions, RF, XGBoost, etc).

Unsupervised Learning: No target, but we cluster the sample/population into different groups that within each group they are quite similar, but between groups they are different (K-means) (Read More: Clustering).

Clustering have 2 key purposes: Analytics cluster: expland the knowledge and give more information about the data (customer segmentation) Useful cluster: use as an intermediate step in a data pipeline

Reinforcement Learning: model is trained to make specific decisions, exposed to the environment that it trains itself continually using trial-and-error (Markov Decision Process)
